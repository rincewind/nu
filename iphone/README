This directory contains a Nukefile for building the iPhone version of Nu.

The Nukefile builds Nu as a static library (libNu.a) that can be linked
into an iPhone application.  When linking this library into your application,
be sure that the -ObjC link flag is specified; otherwise, most of the classes 
in libNu.a will not be linked into your application.

Your application should #include "Nu/Nu.h", which is copied into the include
directory as part of the build process.

Note that libffi is included in the iPhoneSimulator sdk.
