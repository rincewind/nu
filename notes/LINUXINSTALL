To install and build Nu on Linux, follow these steps:

1. First make sure you have installed the following packages (these needed
   to be installed after creating a standard Ubuntu 8.04 install):
   git-core
   Rake
   build-essential
   gobjc
   libffi4-dev
   libreadline5-dev

2. Use git to clone Marcus Hardt's version of nufound using
   
% git clone git://github.com/maccheck/nufound.git
   
   You need to use Hardt's version rather than Tim Burks' because Hardt has
   a fix for a problem with LONG_LONG_MAX that occurs on Ubuntu 8.04.
   Then install the Foundation framework from nufound using the instructions
   in nufound/README.

3. Download pcre-7.7.tar.gz from www.pcre.org.
   Unzip and then build pcre by using (from the pcre-7.7 directory)
  
% ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --enable-utf8
% make
% sudo make install

4. From the main Nu directory:
   
% sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/libNu
% sudo cp -r nu /usr/local/share/libNu

5. From the main Nu directory, use rake to build mininush, a minimal version of the 
   Nu shell:
   
% rake

6. From the main Nu directory, use mininush to run nuke to complete the Nu build
   process:
   
% ./mininush tools/nuke

INSTALL AND TEST NU
-------------------

7. Use mininush again to install Nu, nush, and the Nu tools.

% ./mininush tools/nuke install

Since the copying step uses "sudo", you will be prompted for your password.

6. Test your installation.

% nuke test

(At the moment, the Linux version of Nu fails some tests. This will be fixed.)

From now on, you can use the installed nush to run nuke. To see for
yourself, rebuild everything from scratch:

% nuke clobber
% nuke
% nuke install

See the Nukefile for other useful tasks.
